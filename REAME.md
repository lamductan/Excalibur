# Excalibur

Excalibur is just an "inspirational" name I picked at random for this solution, which is a sort of "incubation chamber" for some libraries that I plan to develop towards making my own web server framework mostly from scratch.

## Usage

There are three general ways to use this solution:

1. Build the libraries in the solution and run their unit tests.
2. Build the WebServer program and its plugins, and configure and run the web server.
3. Run or build the "chatter" React-based web client app.

### Unit tests

Each library in the solution comes with unit tests.  There are two main ways to run the tests:

1. Use [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html).
2. Run individual unit test runners directly (e.g. `build/Uri/test/Debug/UriTests.exe`).

### WebServer

The web server is a stand-alone program hosting the Http::Server class, configuring it,
and loading plug-ins which register themselves as resource handlers for the server.
Server and plug-in configuration is read from a JSON file.

The following plug-ins are provided with the solution:

* ChatRoom -- implements a demonstration "chat room" which uses WebSockets to communicate
  with clients; designed to work with "chatter"
* Echo -- dynamically creates an HTML page showing the user the contents of their
  own HTTP request's headers
* StaticContent -- serves static content from the host file system

To run the WebServer, assemble the desired plug-ins into a folder and give the path from
the WebServer executable to that folder in the "plugins-image" configuration item.  Also
set the "plugins-runtime" configuration item to a path from the WebServer executable
to a temporary folder to be used to actually load and run the plug-in modules.  Set other
configuration items as desired, and run the WebServer.

WebServer looks for its configuration file as named "config.json" and located either
in the current working directory or the directory containing the WebServer executable.
To override the path/name of the configuration file, provide it on the command line
using the "-c" argument, as in:

```bash
WebServer -c path/to/config/server-config.json
```

### chatter

This is a web client app, based on the [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript framework.
It's used to demonstrate the capabilities of the ChatRoom plug-in of the web server.
The user can connect to the chat room, select a nickname, and interact with
the chat room by sending answers to math questions posted by "MathBot2000",
a "bot" which is built into the chat room.

## Programs and libraries hosted in this solution

## Supported platforms / recommended toolchains

* Windows -- [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (Microsoft Visual C++)
* Linux -- clang or gcc
* MacOS -- Xcode (clang)

## Building

There are two distinct steps in the build process:

1. Generation of the build system, using CMake
2. Compiling, linking, etc., using CMake-compatible toolchain

### Prerequisites

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.8 or newer
* C++11 toolchain compatible with CMake for your development platform (e.g. [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) on Windows)

### Build system generation

Generate the build system using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) from the solution root.  For example:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A "x64" ..
```

### Compiling, linking, et cetera

Either use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or your toolchain's IDE to build.
For [CMake](https://cmake.org/):

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --config Release
```
